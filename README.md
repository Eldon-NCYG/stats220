# stats220

This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in Computer Science & Statistics
- I am taking STATS 220 because it seems interesting and is a prerequisite for a course i want to take in the fututre
- I am interested in learning about data science

A meme that captures how I currently feel about my university studies is ![](https://c.tenor.com/8druEACXtX8AAAAd/tenor.gif)
